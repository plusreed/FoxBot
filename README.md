A Discord bot written with discord.js with an interactive CLI <br />
<br />
**WARNING:** Please _don't_ use this for your Discord bot yet. This is a work-in-progress and it's functionality will be **very** limited for a while.

Before opening an Issue about something not working, just know it **might** be intentional!
There are multiple checks in the code which make sure you have read through the configuration file!
With that being said, **READ THE CONFIGURATION FILE.** You won't get far without it!

###Dependencies (will put links here later)

All contributions are welcome! I'd like help with cleaning up the current code at the moment. I feel as if it's very messy. <br />
